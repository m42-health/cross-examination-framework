# MEDIC: Cross-Examination Framework

The Cross-Examination Framework is a Python API designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in clinical generation tasks such as summarization, clinical and SOAP note generation. It is integrated into the broader MEDIC evaluation framework. ([Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07314), [ðŸ¤— leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/m42-health/MEDIC-Benchmark)).

## System Requirements

The Cross-Examination Framework is a Python application that is designed to run on a standard computer even without a GPU. It requires internet access to the OpenAI compatible LLM API or a LLM server running on device.
The application has been successfully tested on the following hardware configurations:

- Macbook Pro with M2 Pro chip and 16GB unified memory
- Linux system with Intel Xeon processor, 128GB RAM, and 1x H100 / H200 GPU

## Installation

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/m42-health/cross-examination-framework.git
cd cross-examination-framework

# Create conda environment and install dependencies
# Installation shoud take under 60 seconds on a Macbook
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate conda environment
conda activate cross-examination-framework
``` 

## Usage

The Cross-Examination Framework provides a RESTful API that can be used to evaluate the performance of LLMs in clinical generation tasks.

Parameters controlling the API are defined in the `pipeline_params.yaml` file. You should change the base_endpoint and the llm_models to the endpoint of the LLM API you want to use to generate the questions and run the cross-examination.

Prompts are defined in the `prompts.yaml` file. You can add or modify the prompts to fit your needs.

```
# Run the application
gunicorn main:app -w 1 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8893
```


## Example API call

For example, to run the cross-examination framework on an original document and its corresponding SOAP note, using OpenAI GPT4o-mini as a cross-examinator (as defined in `pipeline_params.yaml`). You can run the following command

```
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "original_document": "Patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presenting with chest pain that started 2 hours ago. Pain is described as crushing, substernal, radiating to the left arm. EKG shows ST elevation in leads V2-V5. Troponin levels are elevated. Assessment: Acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Plan: Emergent cardiac catheterization.",
    "generated_document": "SOAP Note:\nS: 65M with HTN, DM2 presents with 2hr hx of crushing substernal chest pain radiating to L arm.\nO: EKG: ST elevation V2-V5. Trop elevated.\nA: Acute STEMI.\nP: Urgent cardiac cath."
  }' \

## Scores

This will return the following scores:
- Coverage: Measures how thoroughly the summary covers the original document. A higher score means the summary includes more details from the original.
- Conformity: Also called the non-contradiction score, this checks if the summary avoids contradicting the original document. A higher score means the summary aligns better with the original.
- Consistency: Measures the level of non-hallucination, or how much the summary sticks to the facts in the document. A higher score means the summary is more factual and accurate.
- Conciseness: Measures how brief the summary is. A higher score means the summary is more concise. A negative score means the summary is longer than the original document.
- Overall Score: The average of coverage, conformity, consistency.
